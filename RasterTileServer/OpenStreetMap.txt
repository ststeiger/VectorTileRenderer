It's a big file (on 2021-09-01, the plain OSM XML variant takes over 1478.9 GB 
when uncompressed from the 107.4 GB bzip2-compressed 
or 59.5 GB PBF-compressed

I guess you will need about 3 TB of disk space and and it will take about 2 weeks.

In order to get a more reliable estimate, run the import with a small(er) extract first. 
The australia-oceania.osm.pbf from download.geofabrik.de is a nice test case 
because it is roughly 1/100 of the planet, so import that and multiply the numbers by 100.

You don't want to import the planet with osmosis into an "apidb" database. 
That database schema is not useful for rendering, most analysis, routing, 
or anything except hosting OpenStreetMap data to be edited.


If you decide to do this, it will depend on your disks. 
If using 7200 RPM hard drives, expect it to take 1-3 months. 
I did this a few years ago when the planet was smaller and it took about a month.

I just did a fresh import, but using osm2pgsql, 
size with slim tables: 558G (on a SSD Samsung 850 pro 1To). 
Took 38hours. (1.58 days)

. And at least for osm2pgsql, you also have the option to store the nodes table 
outside your database (--flat-nodes option), 
but I don't know about osmosis, I have never used it.


Well, depending on your needs and the schema you use, 
you could indeed face 2TB storage requirements for the whole planet 
(but not necessarily...). And OSM data is growing steadily each year, 
so factor that in as well.
