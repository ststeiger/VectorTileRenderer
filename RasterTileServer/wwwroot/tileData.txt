To expand on Thaths comments, there are some technical limitations on how many 
characters (more accurately glyphs) can be in one font. There are also 
limitations on merging scripts that have metrics that aren't really compatible 
(line heights and such). That will limit the extent to which we can merge the 
scripts into larger groupings.


Another reason why a single font resource cannot be used is because all modern 
font formats, such as TrueType and OpenType, limit the number of glyphs to 64K. 
Unicode currently includes well over 100K characters, meaning that multiple 
font resources are a necessity. Also, and in my nearly 25 years of font 
development experience, it is best to include glyphs for related scripts in a 
single font resources. Such fonts tend to work better in a broader set of 
environments.
